# OpenWhoop

OpenWhoop is project that allows you to download heart rate data directly from your Whoop4.0 device without Whoop subscription or Whoops servers, making data your own.

### How to Run?

First you need to copy `.env.example` into `.env` and then scan until you find your Whoop device:
```sh
cp .env.example .env
cargo run -r -- scan
```

After you find your device copy its address to `.env` under `WHOOP_ADDR`, and you can download data from your whoop by running:
```sh
cargo run -r -- download-history
```
